This app includes a file upload button where you are able to upload a csv file. 

After the file is uploaded display relevant statistics about the dataset, such as: number of rows, number of columns, how many categorical/numerical/bool variables.

Then you are prompted to choose a column from the csv file.

If the column is numerical it will display the summary stats and a violin distribution plot.

If the column is categorical a table of proportions and a barplot are displayed.
